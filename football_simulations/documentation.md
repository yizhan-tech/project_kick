# Introduction

This project serves as a foundation for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) within a soccer environment. The core design philosophy is the abstraction of physical complexity in favor of tactical decision-making, thus providing a clear signal for agents to learn higher-level coordination and strategy.

# 1. The Physical Environment

The environment is built with a hierarchical structure in Unity, rooted at the `EnvRoot` object.
